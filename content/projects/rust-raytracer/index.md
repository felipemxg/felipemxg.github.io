This is a simple raytracer made in Rust, following the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) tutorial.
I did it to learn the Rust programming language and how ray tracing works.

I've also modified the renderer to use a multithreaded tile-based algorithm.
