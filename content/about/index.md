Hello friend!

I'm a software engineer located in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

I've started programming at about the age 12, wanting to learn how to make videogames.

I've worked on some startups, doing web stuff and participated in a few startup acceleration programs.

I have passion for game programming and low-level optimization. Currently I am learning x86 and ARM architectures.

My main programming language is C99 and C-Style C++, but I also enjoy Rust (currently learning) and have done some work in Python and Golang.

I have done more than 10 000 hours of meditation, two silent retreats, and also have formations in hypnosis and hypnotherapy.

I have a second website about meditation and spirituality where I translate articles from English to Brazilian Portuguese. You can check here: [Centro Pineal](https://centropineal.com.br/).
