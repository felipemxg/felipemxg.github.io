We all eat a large amount of bamboo shoots, from 2 to 4kg of leaves daily. That's a lot of leaves !! 
Being such an important part of our diet, we'd better know what is the nutritional value of those greens.

It turns out a several studies have already been done on that topic and a good starting point would be this [article](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2014/679073/) from P. Nongdam.
